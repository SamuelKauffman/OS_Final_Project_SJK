# OS_Final_Project_SJK

This project is a simple Java server written in Java for CS-310. In this project I made a turn based game where a player rolls 3 dice, and their score is determained on the third mismatch dice. If they rolled a 1 , 1 , 3 their score would be 3. If they get a three of a kind their score is the number they rolled three of a kind.
